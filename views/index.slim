        h2.right The problem with false information.
        p.right Everyone knows not to believe everything we find on the internet. But it is hard not to think of everything we read as facts, scrolling through our facebook feed on a saturday evening. Sometimes it can be really difficult to separate facts from fiction. That is why it has to be more convenient to find the truth, the scientifically verified facts. False information has infected every corner of the internet to the point where the words "fake news" have entered everyone's vocabulary. This cannot continue, the scientific truth has to become the standard once again.

        h2.left Lets encourage facts.
        p.left We all have different feelings in different matters. Some lean towards the right, some lean towards the left. No matter what everyone should be able to ground their opinions in fact. And those who do not have an opinion should be able to at least be aware of what is true and what is not. The value of scientific research seems to have taken a nose dive in the eyes of the public. This has to stop. Let's remember: Facts do not care about your feelings.
